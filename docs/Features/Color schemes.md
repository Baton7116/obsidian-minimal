Minimal includes several popular color schemes with [[Minimal Theme Settings]], and the ability to easily create your own with [[Style Settings]].

## Preset color schemes

You can define separate color schemes for light and dark mode using the [[Minimal Theme Settings]] plugin. Color schemes can also be toggled via the Obsidian command palette or [[Hotkeys]]. Preset color schemes include:

- Atom
- Ayu
- Catppuccin
- Dracula
- [[E-ink mode|E-ink (beta)]]
- [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki)
- Everforest
- Gruvbox
- macOS
- Nord
- Ros√© Pine
- Sky
- Solarized
- Things

## Custom color schemes

You can use the [[Style Settings]] plugin to customize your color scheme.

To see your changes more easily, open Style Settings in a new pane by using the command palette (`CMD + P` by default). Using Style Settings you can customize Minimal's colors, font sizes, font styles, and many more details.

## Advanced color schemes

If you are comfortable with writing CSS, you can easily create your own color scheme [[CSS snippets]]. Explore the structure of the [Nord color scheme CSS](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal/blob/master/src/scss/color-schemes/nord.scss) for example. For reference on what each CSS variable does, see [[Style Settings]].
